    These events can be used to trigger specific actions or optimizations during the execution of the main loop.

    Attributes:
        reset_iteration: Indicates that an event occurs after resetting
            the iteration counter.
        reset_episode: Indicates that an event occurs after resetting
            the episode counter.
        compute_action: Indicates that an event occurs after computing
            an action.
        reset_simulation: Indicates that an event occurs after resetting
            the simulation.

    Usage:
        event = Event.reset_iteration
        if event == Event.reset_iteration:
            # Perform specific action or optimization after resetting the iteration counter
