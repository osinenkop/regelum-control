## Take Control of Your Research



:simple-mlflow: __Manage your experiment data__. Regelum seamlessly captures
every detail of your experiment with little to no configuration required. 
From parameters to performance metrics, every datum is recorded. Through integration with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), 
Regelum streamlines tracking, comparison and real-time monitoring of metrics.

:fontawesome-solid-repeat: __Reproduce your experiments with ease__. Commit hashes and diffs for every experiment are also stored in Regelum, 
offering the ability to reproduce your experiments at any time with simple terminal commands.

:material-wrench-outline: __Configure your experiments efficiently__. Our [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) fork within Regelum introduces enhanced functionaly, 
making the configuration of your RL and Optimal Control tasks more accessible and user-friendly.

:material-bullseye-arrow: __Fine-tune your models to perfection__ and achieve peak performance with minimal effort. 
By integrating with Hydra, regelum inherently adopts Hydra's powerful hyperparameter tuning capability.
