Three-wheel robot with dynamical pushing force and steering torque (extended version of [kinematic robot](3wrobot_kin.md)).
The goal is to park the robot from a predefined initial position to the origin (i.e. the robot coordinates $x = y = 0$) 
and facing the negative X-axis (i.e. the robot angle $\vartheta= 0$)
