A pair of actuated wheels and a ball-wheel are attached to a platform that moves on a flat surface. The wheels roll without
slipping. The pair of control signals for the respective actuators is decomposed into forward velocity $v$ that is aligned with
the direction in which the robot is facing and angular velocity $\omega$ applied to the center of mass of the robot and directed
perpendicular to the platform. The goal is to park the robot from a predefined initial position to the origin (i.e. the robot coordinates $x = y = 0$) 
and facing the negative X-axis (i.e. the robot angle $\vartheta= 0$)
