A jet-powered spaceship is approaching the surface of the moon. It can activate its two engines and thus accelerate itself in the
direction opposite to which the activated engine is facing. The goal is to land at the desired location at the appropriate speed
and angle (i.e. to the point $x = 0, y = 1, \vartheta=0$).
<!-- Below h:`m`, :math:`J`, :math:`g` respectively denote the mass of the spaceship, the moment of inertia of the spaceship with respect
to its axis of rotation and acceleration of gravity. The duration of one episode is set to 1.5 seconds, while the sampling rate of
the pipeline is set to 100 Hz. -->
<!-- Below $\tau_1, \tau_2, Q_1, Q_2$  respectively denote base area of the first tank, base area
of the second tank and two coefficients that determine the magnitude of inbound and outbound flow for the second tank.  -->
