The system consists of a pendulum attached at one end to a fixed point, and the other end being free. The pendulum is initially
pointed downwards and the goal is to apply torque  to the joint to swing the pendulum into an upright position, with its
center of gravity right above the fixed point. The coordinates are chosen in such a way that the upright position corresponds to
the zero point: $\vartheta = \omega = 0$, where $\vartheta$ and $\omega$ are pendulum's angle and angular velocity respectively.
