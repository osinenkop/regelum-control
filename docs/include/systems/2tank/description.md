The two-tank system consists of two tanks which are connected by an open valve. Liquid inflow $U$ to the first tank is
governed by a pump and there is an interconnection between the tanks. In addition, there is a permanent leak from tank 2. The
goal is to keep both tanks exactly 40% full. 
<!-- Below $\tau_1, \tau_2, Q_1, Q_2$  respectively denote base area of the first tank, base area
of the second tank and two coefficients that determine the magnitude of inbound and outbound flow for the second tank.  -->
