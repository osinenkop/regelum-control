To launch experiments, you will need Python programming language installed.

Given code was developed and tested with Python version 3.9.16, we strongly advise to perform all the experiments with this specified version.

In this supplementary you will find the following contents:

1. launch_experiment.py -- a script which is intended to be launched with command-line argument.
2. general -- a folder containing configuration files, needed to specify the experiments to be launched.
